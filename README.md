# CodexEmojis: Collection of Emojis from Unicode

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

This repository contains a collection of emojis extracted from the [Unicode Consortium's Full Emoji List (v16.0)](https://www.unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html), formatted as environment-style constants. This makes it easy to reference emojis directly in your code or scripts.

## ðŸ§¾ Overview

Each emoji is represented by a named constant using uppercase letters and underscores. Example:

```bash
GRINNING_FACE="ðŸ˜€"
FIRE="ðŸ”¥"
PILL="ðŸ’Š"
```

These constants can be sourced in shell scripts, used in apps, or integrated into any project that benefits from named emoji references.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This project is intended for developers who want quick, readable access to emoji constants without needing to repeatedly look them up.

## ðŸ“š Source

Emoji names and data are based on the [Unicode Consortiumâ€™s Full Emoji List (v16.0)](https://www.unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html).
